        body: '**Mergers and acquisitions** is an umbrella term for transactions where ownership of a business changes hands. A **merger** combines two entities into one, while an **acquisition** sees a buyer purchase a target outright. Deals may also take the form of disposals (selling a division), management buyouts (**MBOs**), or joint ventures. Private M&A — where neither party is publicly listed — accounts for the vast majority of deal volume and is where most junior lawyers cut their teeth. Public M&A, governed by the **Takeover Code**, attracts the headlines but follows a distinct, more rigid procedural framework.',

        body: 'A typical private acquisition moves through several stages. It begins with **origination** — a client deciding to buy or sell — followed by preliminary negotiations and the signing of a **non-disclosure agreement** (NDA). The buyer then conducts **due diligence**: a forensic review of the target\'s contracts, litigation exposure, regulatory position, and finances. Once the parties agree on commercial terms, lawyers draft the core transaction documents, negotiate protections, and progress towards **signing**. If the deal has conditions — such as regulatory clearances — there will be a gap before **completion**, when legal title and funds actually transfer.',

        heading: 'Key Documents',
        body: 'The centrepiece of any acquisition is the **share purchase agreement** (SPA) or, for asset deals, an asset purchase agreement. The SPA sets out the price, payment mechanics (often **completion accounts** or a **locked box** structure), and the warranties and indemnities that allocate risk between buyer and seller. The **disclosure letter** qualifies the warranties by setting out known issues — if the seller fails to disclose a material fact, the buyer may have a warranty claim. Ancillary documents include tax covenants, transitional services agreements, and any **restrictive covenants** preventing the seller from competing post-completion.',

Once proceedings begin, the key stages include filing of statements of case (particulars of claim and defence), **disclosure** (each party revealing relevant documents to the other), exchange of witness statements and expert reports, and finally **trial**.

Leading institutional rules include those of the **LCIA** (London Court of International Arbitration), the **ICC** (International Chamber of Commerce), and **ICSID** (for investor-state disputes). A critical advantage of arbitration is **enforceability**: awards made in any of the 170+ signatory states to the **New York Convention** can be enforced in other signatory states, whereas court judgments require separate enforcement arrangements.

A neutral mediator facilitates negotiation between the parties, who retain control over the outcome — unlike in arbitration or litigation, where a third party imposes a decision. Courts actively encourage mediation, and an unreasonable refusal to mediate can result in **adverse costs orders** even if the refusing party wins the case. Other ADR mechanisms include **expert determination** (where an independent expert resolves a specific technical or valuation dispute) and **adjudication** (mandatory in construction disputes under the Housing Grants Act 1996).
