  const prompt = `You are writing a podcast script for "Folio Daily" — a morning audio briefing for law students targeting Magic Circle, Silver Circle, and elite US law firms.

Write a 4–5 minute script (550–650 words of spoken content) for ${dateStr}.

You have exactly three stories. These are the three highest-importance stories from today's briefing, selected by lead score. Do not add others. Go deeper on each one — this is a considered briefing, not a headline ticker.

VOICE & RHYTHM — this will be read aloud by a single TTS voice. Every word must sound natural when spoken, not read:
- ALWAYS use contractions: it's, don't, that's, won't, hasn't, they're, we've. Never write "it is", "do not", "that is" etc.
- Vary sentence length constantly. Follow a long sentence (18–25 words) with a short punchy one (3–8 words). Then medium. Then short again. Monotonous rhythm kills the ear.
- Use em-dashes for natural mid-sentence pauses — the TTS voice will breathe there. Use full stops for hard stops. Use commas sparingly.
- Front-load the interesting fact. "A four-billion-pound takeover — that's the headline from Freshfields this morning." Not "Freshfields has advised on a takeover valued at four billion pounds."
- Max 2 named entities per sentence. If you're naming a firm, a deal value, AND a regulatory body — split it across two sentences.
- Write numbers as words when spoken: "four point two billion", not "£4.2bn". Abbreviations should be spelled out: "CMA" stays as "CMA" (the voice handles acronyms), but "£" becomes "pounds", "%" becomes "per cent".

TRANSITIONS — ban all of these: "Meanwhile", "Furthermore", "In addition", "Turning now to", "Moving on to", "It is worth noting", "It is also important". Instead:
- Jump straight in: "Capital markets. A big IPO just landed."
- Use the topic as a one-word opener: "Disputes." or "Regulation." — then go.
- Or use a question: "What about the energy sector?" — then answer it.
- Silence IS a transition. A full stop and a new paragraph is enough.

STRUCTURE:
- Open with a crisp greeting. Give the date. One sentence on what's ahead — name the three topics, no more.
- For each story: spend 4–6 sentences. Hit the headline fact first. Then the commercial context — which practice areas, which firms. Then one concrete interview line the listener can actually use. End each story cleanly before moving on.
- Address the listener directly at least twice: "Worth knowing for interviews." "If a partner asks you about this — here's your line."
- After the three stories, close with Sector Watch and One to Follow as a quick "what to watch" segment — 2 sentences each, max.
- Sign off: "That's your Folio Daily for ${dateStr}. Good morning."

BANNED PATTERNS — these sound robotic when read aloud:
- "This highlights the importance of..." — just say what matters.
- "It remains to be seen whether..." — say "We'll see" or cut it.
- "In a move that signals..." — say what happened, then say why.
- "The deal, which was..." — avoid relative clauses mid-sentence. Split into two sentences.
- Starting consecutive sentences with the same word.
- Any sentence over 30 words.

OUTPUT: Plain spoken text only. No headings, no bullets, no brackets, no stage directions. Just the words the presenter would say, paragraph by paragraph.

Today's top three stories:

Sector Watch: ${briefing.sectorWatch}
One to Follow: ${briefing.oneToFollow}`;
