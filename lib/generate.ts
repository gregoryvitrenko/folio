Using the news sources provided below, produce exactly 7 stories — one for each of the practice areas below. You MUST cover all seven; omitting any area is an error. Select the highest-signal story available from TODAY's news in each area:

1. M&A — private equity and M&A deals with UK/European nexus
2. Capital Markets — IPOs, debt issuance, restructuring, banking & finance
3. Energy & Tech — energy, infrastructure, or technology with regulatory or transactional relevance (exclude AI — covered separately)
4. Regulation — competition law, financial regulation, or regulatory enforcement
5. Disputes — commercially significant litigation, arbitration, or enforcement action
6. International — cross-border deals, trade law, or global moves relevant to London firms
7. AI & Law — artificial intelligence in legal practice (firm AI strategies, AI tool adoption, AI-related regulation such as the EU AI Act, generative AI in deal-making or litigation, or AI literacy requirements in trainee recruitment)

Return a raw JSON object (no markdown fences, no preamble) with this exact structure:

{
  "stories": [
    {
      "topic": "M&A",
      "headline": "One sharp, declarative sentence — name the parties, deal value, and type of transaction",
      "summary": "10–14 sentences. Write as a senior lawyer who has read the source articles. You MUST include: exact deal value (or 'undisclosed' if not reported), named advisers on each side with their roles (e.g. 'Freshfields advised the target; Linklaters advised the acquirer'), specific regulatory bodies and the exact approval timeline stated in the sources, the precise financing structure (debt/equity split, debt providers named if known), named parties with a line on who they are and why they matter, the strategic rationale as articulated by the principals or as evidenced by the facts, market context grounded in specific numbers or comparables from the sources, and any explicit conditions, break fees, or open questions mentioned. Do not round figures or omit specifics that appear in the source material.",
      "whyItMatters": {
        "ukFirms": "3–4 sentences. Name the specific Magic Circle firms (Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, Linklaters, Allen & Overy Shearman, Clifford Chance, Slaughter and May) or Silver Circle firms (Herbert Smith Freehills, Ashurst, Hogan Lovells, Travers Smith, Macfarlies) best positioned on this matter and explain precisely why — which practice group has the track record, which office has the client relationship, which partner team wins this type of mandate. Note any Takeover Panel, CMA clearance, or FCA authorisation requirements that give UK firms the edge.",
        "usFirms": "2–3 sentences. Name which elite US firms in London (Kirkland & Ellis, Latham & Watkins, Sullivan & Cromwell, Skadden Arps, Paul Weiss, Weil Gotshal & Manges, Davis Polk, Cleary Gottlieb) are the natural choice for the PE sponsor, the leveraged finance package, or the cross-border structuring work, and explain the specific competitive advantage (e.g. Kirkland's dominance of UK PE fund formation, Latham's leveraged finance bench in London). Note any tension with UK firms for the same mandate.",
        "onTheGround": "2–3 sentences. State exactly what a first-seat trainee or NQ at a Magic Circle, Silver Circle, or US firm would do day-to-day on this matter (e.g. drafting CP checklists, running disclosure verification, preparing CMA filing documents, reviewing lock-up agreements). End with one specific data point connecting this to a named broader market cycle or structural trend."
      },
      "talkingPoint": "2–3 confident, analytically sharp sentences suitable for a TC interview or vacation scheme partner chat. Lead with a specific bold observation drawn from the facts (name the deal, the figure, the firm), then give the so-what for law firms and the market.",

  },
  "oneToFollow": {

    "why": "2 sentences explaining precisely why this matters for commercial lawyers and which practice groups it will affect most."
  }
}

Rules:
- You MUST produce exactly 7 stories. Each of the seven topics must appear exactly once: "M&A", "Capital Markets", "Energy & Tech", "Regulation", "Disputes", "International", "AI & Law"
- sources must be an array of 1–3 real URLs drawn from the SOURCE lines in the news context below. Only include URLs that actually appear in the sources provided. Each URL must be a direct article-level link (e.g. ft.com/content/abc123, reuters.com/markets/deals/...) — NEVER a section page, category index, or homepage (e.g. never ft.com/mergers-acquisitions, never bloomberg.com/markets). If the only available URL for a story is a section/category page, omit it and use [].
- Every story must be from TODAY's news — do not recycle stories from previous days
- Name specific law firms, banks, and advisers wherever the sources mention them
- If a practice area has no strong story from the provided sources, use your training knowledge to produce a credible, current-feeling story for that area — but still mark sources as []
- firms must be an array of 2–5 short law firm names explicitly mentioned in this story (e.g. "Freshfields", "Linklaters", "Kirkland"). Use short names only — no "& Partners", no "LLP". If no firms are named, use []

Tone: Intelligent but not stuffy. Brief a sharp colleague, not a filing report. Zero filler phrases ("it is worth noting", "this highlights the importance of", "in conclusion"). If a number is imprecise, say so briefly rather than omitting it.
