### 🚧 v1.2 Editorial Design (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Elevate Folio's visual register from polished to genuinely editorial — serif headlines, newspaper-style layout hierarchy, tighter spacing rhythm, and a conversion-optimised upgrade page.

- [x] **Phase 13: Typography & Spacing** (1/1 plans) - Playfair Display serif, updated type scale sizes, and vertical rhythm improvements across the design system — completed 2026-03-12
- ~~**Phase 14: Editorial Layout**~~ — reverted 2026-03-12 (user preferred flat grid over lead story hierarchy)
- [ ] **Phase 15: Conversion Page** - Upgrade page redesigned as editorial section with outcome framing, social proof, and accent CTA

## Phase Details

### Phase 13: Typography & Spacing
**Goal**: The design system renders editorial-quality type — Playfair Display serif on headlines, correctly-weighted, with legible labels and comfortable reading rhythm
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v1.2)
**Requirements**: TYPO-01, TYPO-02, TYPO-03, TYPO-04, SPACE-01, SPACE-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Story card headlines render in Playfair Display serif at semibold weight (600), visibly distinct from body Inter text
  2. Section/topic labels are legible at 11px minimum — no squinting required on any device
  3. Body text and article text renders at 16px — comfortable for sustained reading sessions
  4. Vertical gap between cards and sections is generous (gap-y-6 or gap-y-8), giving the page room to breathe
  5. Internal card spacing between headline, excerpt, and meta feels balanced — no cramped stacking
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [x] 13-01-PLAN.md — Type token updates, headline weight correction, grid and card spacing increase

### Phase 14: Editorial Layout
**Goal**: The home briefing view has newspaper-style hierarchy — a dominant lead story announces the day's top item, secondary stories frame it, and the remaining grid follows below a clear visual break
**Depends on**: Phase 13
**Requirements**: LAYOUT-01, LAYOUT-02, LAYOUT-03, LAYOUT-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Opening the home briefing, the lead story is immediately visually dominant — larger format, clearly the primary item
  2. Two secondary stories appear below the lead in a 2-column row, bridging the featured section and the grid
  3. A visual divider (rule or spacing break) cleanly separates the featured section from the remaining stories
  4. The remaining stories render in a standard grid below the divider — consistent with prior layout
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [x] 14-01-PLAN.md — Featured StoryCard variant + editorial layout hierarchy in StoryGrid

### Phase 15: Conversion Page
**Goal**: The upgrade page reads as a premium editorial destination, not a SaaS pricing table — outcome framing, social proof signals, and a visually distinct CTA that earns the click
**Depends on**: Phase 13
**Requirements**: CONV-01, CONV-02, CONV-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The upgrade page layout uses editorial/newspaper section visual language — not card grids, not feature bullet lists in SaaS style
  2. An outcome-framed social proof section is visible — student count or testimonial placeholders that communicate credibility
  3. The primary CTA button uses a differentiated accent colour that stands out clearly from the stone/zinc page palette
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [ ] 13-01-PLAN.md — Type token updates, headline weight correction, grid and card spacing increase
