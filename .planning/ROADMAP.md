### 🚧 v1.3 Editorial Interior (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Transform interior pages from a generic card-stack pattern into a genuinely editorial product — warm paper tone sitewide, newspaper masthead header with dateline, firm profile redesign with stat strip and varied section treatments, and a dark ink conversion panel on the upgrade page.

- [x] **Phase 16: Global Design + Logo + Header** - Warm paper background sitewide, JetBrains Mono section labels restored, new wordmark deployed, editorial dateline in header (completed 2026-03-12)
- [ ] **Phase 17: Firm Profile Redesign** - Stat strip, visually differentiated sections, editorial "Why This Firm?" callouts, clean typographic interview question numbering
- [ ] **Phase 18: Secondary Pages + Conversion Polish** - Quiz mode two-panel layout, quiz date visual states, firms directory tier headers, upgrade page serif titles and dark CTA panel

## Phase Details

### Phase 13: Typography & Spacing
**Goal**: The design system renders editorial-quality type — Playfair Display serif on headlines, correctly-weighted, with legible labels and comfortable reading rhythm
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v1.2)
**Requirements**: TYPO-01, TYPO-02, TYPO-03, TYPO-04, SPACE-01, SPACE-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Story card headlines render in Playfair Display serif at semibold weight (600), visibly distinct from body Inter text
  2. Section/topic labels are legible at 11px minimum — no squinting required on any device
  3. Body text and article text renders at 16px — comfortable for sustained reading sessions
  4. Vertical gap between cards and sections is generous (gap-y-6 or gap-y-8), giving the page room to breathe
  5. Internal card spacing between headline, excerpt, and meta feels balanced — no cramped stacking
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [x] 13-01-PLAN.md — Type token updates, headline weight correction, grid and card spacing increase

### Phase 14: Editorial Layout
**Goal**: The home briefing view has newspaper-style hierarchy — a dominant lead story announces the day's top item, secondary stories frame it, and the remaining grid follows below a clear visual break
**Depends on**: Phase 13
**Requirements**: LAYOUT-01, LAYOUT-02, LAYOUT-03, LAYOUT-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Opening the home briefing, the lead story is immediately visually dominant — larger format, clearly the primary item
  2. Two secondary stories appear below the lead in a 2-column row, bridging the featured section and the grid
  3. A visual divider (rule or spacing break) cleanly separates the featured section from the remaining stories
  4. The remaining stories render in a standard grid below the divider — consistent with prior layout
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [x] 14-01-PLAN.md — Featured StoryCard variant + editorial layout hierarchy in StoryGrid

### Phase 15: Conversion Page
**Goal**: The upgrade page reads as a premium editorial destination, not a SaaS pricing table — outcome framing, social proof signals, and a visually distinct CTA that earns the click
**Depends on**: Phase 13
**Requirements**: CONV-01, CONV-02, CONV-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The upgrade page layout uses editorial/newspaper section visual language — not card grids, not feature bullet lists in SaaS style
  2. An outcome-framed social proof section is visible — student count or testimonial placeholders that communicate credibility
  3. The primary CTA button uses a differentiated accent colour that stands out clearly from the stone/zinc page palette
**Plans**: 1 plan
Plans:
- [x] 15-01-PLAN.md — Editorial layout, outcome grid, pull quote, amber CTA button

### Phase 16: Global Design + Logo + Header
**Goal**: Every page carries a warm paper tone, section labels use the correct monospace typeface, the new Folio wordmark is live, and the header reads as a newspaper masthead with an editorial dateline
**Depends on**: Phase 15
**Requirements**: GDES-01, GDES-02, GDES-03, HDR-01, HDR-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Every page (home, article, firm, quiz, archive, etc.) has the warm cream paper background (#F9F7F2) — no cold white or stone-50 remnants visible
  2. Section/category labels (`.section-label`) render in JetBrains Mono — visually distinct from Inter body text
  3. The header shows the striped-F + "olio" wordmark — the new logo is live on every page, not the old plain text
  4. The header displays a dateline line (Vol. · No. · Day, Date · London Edition) in small uppercase tracking beneath the wordmark
  5. The Folio wordmark in the header uses tight letter-spacing (-0.03em) matching the brand studio treatment
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [ ] 16-01-PLAN.md — Warm paper CSS variable, body bg-paper, .section-label font-mono
- [ ] 16-02-PLAN.md — Wordmark letter-spacing, editorial dateline, commit logo files

### Phase 17: Firm Profile Redesign
**Goal**: The firm profile page feels like a premium editorial dossier — a prominent data strip leads, content sections use visually varied treatments, and "Why This Firm?" reads as a crafted editorial callout rather than a generic card
**Depends on**: Phase 16
**Requirements**: FIRM-01, FIRM-02, FIRM-03, FIRM-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Visiting any firm profile, NQ salary, TC salary, annual intake, and seat count appear in a horizontal stat strip immediately below the firm name — scannable at a glance
  2. The firm profile page has at least two visually distinct section treatments — not all sections use the same left-border card pattern
  3. The "Why This Firm?" section uses editorial numbered callouts with large background numbers behind each point — clearly different from the other sections
  4. Interview questions on the firm profile are numbered with clean typographic numbering (1., 2., 3.) — no chip or box styling around the number
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 18: Secondary Pages + Conversion Polish
**Goal**: The quiz entry experience, firms directory, and upgrade page all reach the editorial standard set in Phases 16-17 — distinct layouts for distinct purposes, with the upgrade page anchored by a dark conversion panel
**Depends on**: Phase 17
**Requirements**: QUIZ-01, QUIZ-02, FDIR-01, CONV-04, CONV-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The quiz entry page shows Daily and Deep Practice as two clearly differentiated editorial panels — the choice is visually obvious without reading the labels
  2. The quiz date list visually distinguishes today, available past dates, and completed dates — the user can tell their completion status at a glance
  3. Tier headers in the firms directory (Magic Circle, Silver Circle, etc.) use a full-width editorial rule treatment — clearly separating tiers, not just bold text
  4. Upgrade page feature titles use serif font — consistent with the editorial register of the rest of the product
  5. The upgrade page CTA panel has a dark stone-900 background with a border-style button — a strong visual anchor that ends the page with authority
**Plans**: TBD
