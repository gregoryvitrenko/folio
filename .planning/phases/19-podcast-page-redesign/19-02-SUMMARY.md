# Dependency graph

provides:
  - Editorial podcast archive page with date-split rows, vertical rule dividers, large font-mono day numbers, 3-letter month abbreviations, duration and audio status indicators
affects: [podcast-archive, podcast-page]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - "Editorial episode row: large font-mono day + section-label month + w-px vertical rule + title + metadata — reusable for any archive/listings page"
    - "parseDateParts() helper for splitting YYYY-MM-DD into zero-padded day + 3-letter uppercase month"

key-files:
  created: []
  modified:
    - app/podcast/archive/page.tsx

key-decisions:
  - "Topic chip omitted intentionally — listPodcastDatesWithStatus() returns only { date, hasAudio }, no per-episode topic data stored"
  - "Duration is a static ~8 min placeholder matching editorial design intent"
  - "Non-playable rows use opacity-40 rather than a separate disabled style — simpler and visually consistent"

patterns-established:
  - "parseDateParts(dateStr): { day, month } — splits YYYY-MM-DD into zero-padded day + 3-letter uppercase month for editorial date columns"
  - "Vertical rule as w-px self-stretch element separating date column from content — newspaper listings pattern"

# Phase 19 Plan 02: Podcast Archive Summary

**Podcast archive redesigned from plain link list to newspaper broadcast-listings layout with large font-mono day numbers, 3-letter month abbreviations, thin vertical rule dividers, duration indicators, and audio status badges**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~8 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-12T21:00:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-12T21:08:00Z
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Replaced generic round-rect card list with editorial episode rows: large `font-mono text-2xl` day + `section-label` month + `w-px` vertical rule + date string + `~8 min` duration + Audio/No audio badge
- Converted all `zinc-*` classes to `stone-*` throughout the file
- Replaced `rounded-xl` with `rounded-card`, removed inline font/tracking styles in favour of `.section-label` utility class
- Added `parseDateParts()` helper for splitting date strings into display parts
- Month group headings now use `section-label` class matching editorial system
- Non-playable rows rendered with `opacity-40` for clean disabled treatment

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Redesign archive page with editorial episode rows** - `552ec1b` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** (docs: complete plan — added after state updates)

## Files Created/Modified

- `app/podcast/archive/page.tsx` - Full editorial redesign: date-split rows, vertical rule, duration, audio status; all zinc removed, rounded-card, section-label throughout

## Decisions Made

- Topic chip omitted — `listPodcastDatesWithStatus()` only returns `{ date, hasAudio }`, no topic metadata available
- Static `~8 min` duration placeholder used — no actual duration stored per episode
- `opacity-40` for non-playable rows keeps disabled state visually coherent without a separate component

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Podcast archive page now matches editorial design system
- Pattern established for date-column + vertical rule row layout; applicable to any future archive/listings pages
