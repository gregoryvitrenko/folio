# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-12)

**Core value:** Students who use Folio daily walk into TC interviews knowing what's happening in the market and how to talk about it — giving them a credible edge over unprepared candidates.
**Current focus:** Milestone v1.2 — Editorial Design (Phase 13: Typography & Spacing, ready to plan)

## Current Position

Phase: 13 of 15 (Typography & Spacing)
Plan: — (not yet planned)
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-12 — v1.2 roadmap created, 13 requirements mapped to 3 phases

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0% (v1.2 phases)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v1.2 Roadmap: TYPO and SPACE merged into Phase 13 — both touch the same design system layer (type scale tokens, CSS vars, Tailwind config); shipping together avoids partial states where font is serif but spacing is still cramped
- v1.2 Roadmap: Phase 14 depends on Phase 13 — editorial layout uses the new Playfair Display tokens on the lead story headline; cannot verify layout success criteria without the type changes in place
- v1.2 Roadmap: Phase 15 depends on Phase 13 (not Phase 14) — upgrade page redesign is independent of the home layout; only needs the new type tokens and accent colour available
- Coarse granularity applied: 13 requirements compressed into 3 coherent phases rather than 4 thin ones

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 13: Playfair Display must be added via next/font (Google Fonts) — verify it integrates cleanly with existing Inter/JetBrains Mono font loading in layout.tsx before touching type tokens
- Phase 15: CONV-02 includes social proof placeholders — real student count data not yet available; placeholders must look intentional (not empty)
