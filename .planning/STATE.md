# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-09)

**Core value:** Students who use Folio daily walk into TC interviews knowing what's happening in the market and how to talk about it — giving them a credible edge over unprepared candidates.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Design Tokens

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Design Tokens)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-09 — Roadmap created; 21 v1 requirements mapped across 5 phases

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Coarse granularity applied — 5 phases retained despite coarse setting because dependency order is a hard constraint (tokens before components before pages)
- Roadmap: Analytics (ANLYT-01, ANLYT-02) grouped with utility pages in Phase 5 — both are "apply and verify" tasks that share the same deployment window
- [Phase 01-design-tokens]: Reduced --radius from 0.5rem to 0.25rem for flat editorial feel; rounded-sm now ~0px intentionally
- [Phase 01-design-tokens]: Used theme.extend.fontSize to preserve all Tailwind default text-* sizes
- [Phase 01-design-tokens]: Radius tokens use direct values not calc chains for predictability
- [Phase 02-shell]: bg-paper replaces all bg-stone-50 dark:bg-stone-950 pairs in shell components — single dark-aware token
- [Phase 02-shell]: text-display used for wordmark h1, removing responsive breakpoint font-size pair and redundant font-bold
- [Phase 02-shell]: text-label used for all 10-11px mono/sans labels in header and nav triggers, bundling size and letterSpacing
- [Phase 02-shell]: Sticky footer: body flex flex-col + main flex-1 + footer mt-auto pattern established
- [Phase 02-shell]: Footer link order locked: Feedback · Terms · Privacy · Contact · LinkedIn; mailto links no target=_blank, LinkedIn target=_blank

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3 risk: Typography changes on the 8-story homepage grid must be tested at 375px after every change — mobile is 60-70% of student traffic
- Phase 4 risk: Any deploy touching `/upgrade` or `StoryCard.tsx` requires end-to-end Stripe checkout smoke test in incognito
- Phase 5 dependency: Vercel Analytics install (ANLYT-01) must precede conversion event tracking (ANLYT-02)
- Known issue: `app/api/generate/route.ts:16` has hardcoded fallback ADMIN_USER_ID — unrelated to this milestone but should be cleaned up
