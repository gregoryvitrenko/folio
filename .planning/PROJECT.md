# Folio

## What This Is

Folio is a daily briefing tool for UK law students targeting Magic Circle, Silver Circle, National, and US firm training contracts. It delivers AI-generated news briefings, quizzes, firm interview packs (46 firms), aptitude tests, sector primers with interview questions, an audio podcast, and AI-curated legal events — all focused on commercial awareness. Subscription product at £4/month with a viral referral system, built and marketed by the owner (LLB student).

## Core Value

Students who use Folio daily walk into TC interviews knowing what's happening in the market and how to talk about it — giving them a credible edge over unprepared candidates.

### Active

**Current Milestone: v1.2 — Editorial Design**

**Goal:** Elevate Folio's visual register from polished to genuinely editorial — serif headlines, newspaper-style layout hierarchy, tighter spacing rhythm, and a conversion-optimised upgrade page.

**Target features:**
- Playfair Display serif on story card headlines (semibold, not bold)
- Editorial layout hierarchy: lead story + 2 secondary + divider + remaining grid
- More generous spacing and vertical rhythm
- Upgrade page redesign: newspaper section feel, outcome framing, social proof

- [ ] Logo/wordmark — proper brand mark, not just text (design-first; implement in v1.3)
- [ ] Social proof — trust signals: student count, testimonials, or credibility cues (live data when available)
- [ ] Trainee experience on firm profiles — "Culture & Experience" section per firm
- [ ] Firm interview packs: PDF export

### Out of Scope

- Multi-voice audio — multiplies ElevenLabs spend against 100k/month cap
- Native mobile app — web-first, no revenue to justify native yet
- Real-time features (live feed, push notifications) — complexity vs. value unclear
- Custom Clerk production instance — requires domain transfer off Cloudflare; dev keys work fine

## Current State

- **v1.0 shipped:** 2026-03-10 — Design token system, editorial polish, conversion surfaces, analytics, bug fixes
- **v1.1 shipped:** 2026-03-12 — Mobile responsive, 46 firms, podcast archive, primer interview Qs, events section, GDPR digest, referral system
- **Live product**: folioapp.co.uk, Vercel Pro
- **Active services**: Clerk auth, Stripe payments, Upstash Redis, ElevenLabs TTS, Tavily search, Resend email
- **Infrastructure budget**: ~£34/month. Owner budget cap £50/month.
- **ElevenLabs**: 100k chars/month (Creator tier). Daniel voice only. MP3s cached in Vercel Blob.
- **Cron jobs**: Daily briefing (06:00 UTC), events (Mon + Thu 07:00 UTC), digest (Sun 08:00 UTC)
- **Marketing channel**: LinkedIn, university law societies, peer networks. Design + content now ready for serious push.

## Constraints

- **Budget**: £50/month max infra. Services at free tier limits. No paid design tools.
- **ElevenLabs**: 100k chars/month hard cap. Audio generation must stay within budget.
- **Tech stack**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS. No stack changes.
- **Auth**: Clerk dev keys (proven-yak-30.clerk.accounts.dev). Production keys require domain transfer off Cloudflare.
- **Solo operator**: Owner handles dev, marketing, support. Solutions must be maintainable by one person.
- **No emojis in UI**: Design language is minimal, newspaper feel. No decorative emoji.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Newspaper/editorial direction for design | Matches the content (legal news briefings) and target audience (serious law students) | ✓ Good |
| Daniel voice only (ElevenLabs) | Multi-voice multiplies monthly spend against 100k cap | ✓ Good |
| Clerk dev keys (not production) | Cloudflare CNAME conflict blocks production instance; dev keys work without proxy | ✓ Good |
| Stone/zinc Tailwind palette | Content areas (stone) vs. UI chrome (zinc) — consistent with editorial feel | ✓ Good |
| Design lift before heavy marketing | Site must feel premium before driving paid signups | ✓ Good |
| National tier (rose) for large UK firms | Distinguishes from Silver Circle; rose accent aligns with Tailwind palette | ✓ Good |
| Events free tier (no paywall) | Growth feature — attracts users before asking for money | ✓ Good |
| Unsubscribe keyed by email not userId | Simpler for digest route which already has emails from Stripe | ✓ Good |
| Tavily news topic + days:1 for freshness | Prevents stale articles in daily briefings | ✓ Good |
| Conversion feature deferred | No user data yet to identify actual friction point | — Pending |
