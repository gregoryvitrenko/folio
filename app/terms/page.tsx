        <Section title="Subscriptions and billing">
          <p>
            The Service is offered on a free tier and a paid subscription tier at £4 per month. Paid subscriptions are billed monthly and renew automatically until cancelled.
          </p>

        </Section>

        <Section title="Refunds">
          <p>
            Under the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013, you have a right to cancel a digital service within 14 days of purchase. By accessing paid features immediately after subscribing, you acknowledge that the service has begun and agree that the 14-day right to cancel is waived for the period already used.
